# Phase 2 Implementation - Campus Event Notifier

## Overview

Phase 2 of the Campus Event Notifier app has been successfully implemented with Firebase Authentication, local storage-only data management, and role-based club membership verification.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication System
- **Firebase Authentication** integration with email/password and Google OAuth
- **Automatic user profile creation** from Firebase Auth data
- **Session management** handled entirely by Firebase (no custom sessions)

### 🏛️ Local Storage Architecture
- **Clubs**: Seeded from `snhu_clubs_with_hashes.json` with verification codes
- **User Profiles**: Local profiles with roles (student/member) and club memberships
- **Events**: Shared event list visible to all users on the device
- **Saved Events**: Per-user saved events (optional feature)

### 🎯 Role-Based Access Control
- **Student Role**: Default role for new users
- **Member Role**: Granted after successful club verification
- **Create Event Button**: Only visible to club members for their respective clubs

### 🔒 Club Verification System
- **SHA-256 hashing** for verification codes
- **Club name/ID resolution** for flexible input
- **Membership tracking** with automatic role elevation

## Data Models

### User Profile
```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  uid: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'student' | 'member';
  memberships: string[]; // Club IDs
}
```

### Club
```typescript
interface Club {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  codeHash: string; // SHA-256 hash of verification code
}
```

### Event
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  clubId: string;
  dateISO: string;
  location: string;
  createdBy: string; // User UID
  createdAt: number; // Timestamp
}
```

## Key Services

### Profile Service
- `getProfile(uid)`: Get user profile from local storage
- `upsertProfileFromAuth(user)`: Create/update profile from Firebase user
- `verifyClubMembership(uid, clubInput, codePlaintext)`: Verify and join club
- `isClubMember(uid, clubId)`: Check membership status

### Events Service
- `listEvents()`: Get all events sorted by date
- `listClubEvents(clubId)`: Get events for specific club
- `createEvent(eventInput, createdBy)`: Create new event
- `getSavedEvents(uid)`: Get user's saved events
- `saveEvent(uid, eventId)`: Save event for user
- `unsaveEvent(uid, eventId)`: Remove saved event

### Authentication Hook
- `useAuthUser()`: Manages auth state and profile synchronization
- Returns `{ user, profile, loading }` for components

## User Flows

### 1. App Initialization
1. Firebase Auth initializes
2. Club data seeds from JSON file (one-time only)
3. Auth state listener activates
4. User profile created/updated on sign-in

### 2. Authentication Flow
1. User signs in with email/password or Google
2. Firebase handles authentication
3. Local profile automatically created/updated
4. User role defaults to "student"

### 3. Club Verification Flow
1. User navigates to "Verify Club Membership"
2. Enters club name/ID and verification code
3. System hashes code and matches against stored hash
4. On success: role elevated to "member", club added to memberships
5. Profile updated in local storage

### 4. Event Creation Flow
1. User must be club member to see "Create Event" button
2. Event creation form with club selection (limited to user's clubs)
3. Event saved to local storage with creator info
4. Event appears in club's event list

## Security Features

### Verification Code Security
- **No plaintext storage**: Only SHA-256 hashes stored locally
- **Secure hashing**: Uses CryptoJS for React Native compatibility
- **Input validation**: Club name/ID resolution with error handling

### Role-Based Access
- **UI Guards**: Create Event button only visible to club members
- **Service Validation**: Backend validation of permissions
- **Profile Integrity**: Automatic role elevation on verification

## Environment Configuration

The app supports environment variables for Firebase configuration:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_FIREBASE_EMULATOR` (development only)

## Dependencies Added

- `react-native-crypto-js`: For SHA-256 hashing in React Native
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: For local storage (already present)

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Club Verification
- Use verification codes from the JSON file (e.g., "SNHU-ACAD-accounting_society-2025")
- Try different club names/IDs
- Test invalid codes

### 2. Role-Based Features
- Sign in as student → verify club membership → become member
- Create events only after becoming club member
- Verify Create Event button visibility

### 3. Data Persistence
- Events persist across app restarts
- User profiles maintain memberships
- Club data seeds only once

## Next Steps

The Phase 2 implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- Event management and discovery
- Club membership verification
- Role-based access control
- Local data persistence

All requirements have been met with clean, production-quality code and comprehensive error handling.
